Much of this code is based off of the tutorials found at: http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/

Running this code requires the installation of theano. Instructions here: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html

test.py contains test code for running the 1-layer denoising autoencoder, with a logistic regression classifier.

To run tests for autoencoder_1d, convolutional_mlp, and basic_logistic, just run the files as is. They contain main's that will train and test the model.

To adjust image scaling, look in util.py's load_data function.

To train new models off of new data, remove the .pkl files. These allow you to use the same data for multiple models, or to avoid redoing work if something
crashes part way through.
